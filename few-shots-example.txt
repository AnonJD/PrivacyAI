TSCC prompting GPT-4o-mini example: 
Example 1: “Jakndnd is talking about her brother pIoM jKpjhobj, who's skipped her birthday party a few times.”\n
You should label Jakndnd and pIoM jKpjhobj as PII since it appears that Jakndnd exhibits human behavior, and pIoM jKpjhobj is her brother.\n
Example 2: “Occasionally, Anfoaipjqd likes to have a coffee chat with her friends.”\n
You should label Anfoaipjqd as PII since only humans can have coffee chats.\n
Example 3: “Ascar likes to talk about gioibajhjjo.”\n
You should label both Ascar and gioibajhjjo since you cannot be sure whether gioibajhjjo is a person or not, so you should consider it to avoid false negatives. Ascar is talking, so he is also a human.\n
